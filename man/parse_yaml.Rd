\title{Parse YAML 1.2 document(s) into base R structures.}
\usage{
parse_yaml(text, multi = FALSE, simplify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{Character vector; elements are concatenated with \code{"\\n"}.}

\item{multi}{When \code{TRUE}, return a list containing all documents in the stream.}

\item{simplify}{When \code{FALSE}, keep YAML sequences as R lists instead of simplifying to atomic vectors.}
}
\description{
Supports scalars, sequences, and mappings; YAML tags are preserved in a
\code{yaml_tag} attribute when possible. YAML anchors and aliases are resolved
by the parser, so aliases behave like copies of their target nodes.
}
